{"name":"Legend Highlighter","tagline":"for Highcharts.js","body":"### What is it?\r\nLegend Highlighter is a plugin for Highcharts.js, which adds a new data series highlight effect to your charts.\r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\nWell, it's very simple - just hover over one of the data series label in legend box. You'll see, that all data series except hovered one are dimmed (to be specific, they will be transparent). An additional \"pie chart\" effect makes the hovered portion of data sliced out of the chart.\r\n\r\n### How do I start using the magic?\r\n1. Include our plugin in your page:  \r\n```\r\n<script src=\"source\"></script>\r\n```\r\n2. Enable the plugin by adding this code to your chart options:  \r\n```\r\nlegend: {\r\n    highlightSeries: {\r\n        enabled: true\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Can I see any demos?\r\n---Add link to demos---\r\n\r\n### So, what can it actually do?\r\n* Dim charts of one of the following types: `line`, `spline`, `area`, `areaspline`, `arearange`, `areasplinerange`, `column`, `columnrange`, `bar`, `scatter`, `bubble`, `boxplot`, `errorbar`, `waterfall`, `pie`, `gauge`, `funnel`\r\n* Slice out hovered `pie` chart portion and present it to the user\r\n* Support multiple charts of different types in one painting area\r\n* Remember \"user selected\" chart portion and restore the selection when user stops hovering over a label (usefull if using `allowPointSelect` in `pie` chart)\r\n* Properly handle all `linkedSeries` - if other series are linked to the series currently beeing hovered over, they won't be dimmed (because they are treated as a part of hovered series)\r\n\r\n### Are there any settings?\r\nYes, you can change plugin settings by adding new entries in chart options, under `legend.highlightSeries` group.\r\nCurrently, the plugin will only use three additional options:\r\n* `dimPiePieces` - if set to `true`, plugin will additionally dim pie portions not hovered over by user\r\n* `defaultOpacity` - opacity level of chart element in \"normal state\" (default: 1)\r\n* `dimmedOpacity` - opacity level of chart element in \"dimmed state\" (default: 0.25)\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\n---Authors---\r\n\r\n### License\r\n---License---","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
